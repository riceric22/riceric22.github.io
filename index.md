I am an assistant professor at the [Department of Computer and Information Science](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania, working on debugging machine learning and making systems actually do what we want them to do. I'm also a part of the [ASSET Center](https://blog.seas.upenn.edu/penn-engineerings-new-asset-center-will-focus-on-the-safety-explainability-and-trustworthiness-of-ai-systems/) on safe, explainable, and trustworthy AI systems. Previously, I completed my PhD at CMU advised by [Zico Kolter](https://zicokolter.com/), and did a postdoc with [Aleksander Madry](https://people.csail.mit.edu/madry/). 

*PhD applicants*: If you're interested, you will need to 

1. Apply to the [CIS department](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/graduate/program-offerings/doctoral-program/) 
2. Select me as a potential advisor in your application. 

*Undergraduates/masters students*: If you are a UPenn student and are interested in doing independent machine learning research, then (1) take CIS 5200 (2) read this [blog post](https://www.alextamkin.com/essays/tips-for-new-researchers). Then send me an email and we can chat. If you are not at UPenn, I do not currently have opportunities for external students. 

I am currently teaching a CIS 5200 Machine Learning for Spring 2023 with [Surbhi Goel](https://www.surbhigoel.com/) Check out the course website [here](https://machine-learning-upenn.github.io/).
