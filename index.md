I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Computer Science and Artifical Intelligence Laboratory](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) of [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://www.mit.edu/), where I am advised by [Aleksander Madry](https://people.csail.mit.edu/madry/). Previously, I completed my PhD at the [Machine Learning Department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) of [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) where I was advised by [Zico Kolter](https://zicokolter.com/). 

My research interests are centered around machine learning, optimization, and robustness. My goal is to ensure that deep learning models are actually doing what we want them to do, in order to make them safe, robust, and reliable. To do so, I have worked on training networks with provable guarantees, bridging the gap between robustness and the real world, and developing tools for debugging models and data.
