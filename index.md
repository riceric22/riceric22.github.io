I am an assistant professor at the [Department of Computer and Information Science](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania. I'm also a part of the [ASSET Center](https://blog.seas.upenn.edu/penn-engineerings-new-asset-center-will-focus-on-the-safety-explainability-and-trustworthiness-of-ai-systems/) on safe, explainable, and trustworthy AI systems. Previously, I completed my PhD at CMU advised by [Zico Kolter](https://zicokolter.com/), and did a postdoc with [Aleksander Madry](https://people.csail.mit.edu/madry/). 

I am recruiting PhD students for Fall 2023. If you're interested, apply to the [CIS department](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/graduate/program-offerings/doctoral-program/) and select me as a potential advisor in your application. If you are a UPenn student and are interested in doing machine learning research, send me an email. 

I am also teaching a special topics course this Fall 2022 called *7000-05: Debugging Data and Models*. Check out the course website [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link debugml.md %}).
