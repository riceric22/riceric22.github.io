    <title>Interactive Guide: Generating Abstracts & Introductions</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as an interactive lab notebook with a clear, tab-based structure to separate the major sections: Abstract, Introduction, Synthesis, and Reflection. This was chosen to allow students to focus on one area at a time without being overwhelmed by a long scroll. Within each experimental section, a nested accordion structure is used for each distinct strategy (e.g., Minimalist vs. Holistic). This keeps the interface clean and encourages a methodical, step-by-step approach to the exercises. Actionable elements like copy-to-clipboard buttons are integrated directly into the workflow to facilitate the note-taking process. This user-centric, organized structure transforms the static outline into a dynamic and effective learning tool. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Main Navigation: Report Info -> 4 main sections of the worksheet. Goal -> Organize & Guide. Method -> Tabbed navigation UI. Interaction -> Click to switch main content views. Justification -> The most effective way to segment a complex exercise into manageable parts.
        - Experimental Strategies: Report Info -> Different methods for abstracts/intros. Goal -> Compare & Organize. Method -> Accordion component within each tab. Interaction -> Click to expand/collapse. Justification -> Hides detailed content by default to prevent cognitive overload and allows users to focus on one experiment at a time.
        - Prompt Examples: Report Info -> Example prompts for each strategy. Goal -> Action. Method -> Code-style blocks with a copy button. Interaction -> Click to copy. Justification -> Provides direct utility for students to use in their own LLM sessions.
        - Synthesis Template: Report Info -> The structure of a master prompt. Goal -> Instruct & Guide. Method -> A structured list within a styled card. Justification -> Presents the template as a clear, actionable artifact to be built.
        - Reflection Questions: Report Info -> Final list of questions. Goal -> Action. Method -> A numbered list with a single "Copy All" button. Justification -> Streamlines the final note-taking step based on previous user feedback.
