    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page, top-to-bottom linear guide. This is a multi-step process where each part builds on the last (Expert Creates Test -> Learner Studies -> Learner Self-Assesses -> Learner Takes Exam -> Learner Grades -> Reflect). A sequential layout with clear <section> dividers is the most intuitive structure. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Main Navigation: Sequential steps -> Single-page layout with clear sections. Goal -> Guide a linear process. Justification -> Reinforces the start-to-finish nature of the learning exercise.
        - Tasks/Steps: Different phases -> Styled cards/boxes. Goal -> Organize & Delineate. Interaction -> Read and follow. Justification -> Visually separates the distinct phases of the workflow.
        - Prompts/Code: Example prompts -> Code-style blocks with copy buttons. Goal -> Action. Interaction -> Click to copy. Justification -> Provides direct utility.
