    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page, top-to-bottom linear guide. This is a multi-step process where each part builds on the last (Pre-Test -> Study -> Self-Assess -> Exam -> Grade -> Reflect). A sequential layout with clear <section> dividers is the most intuitive structure. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Main Navigation: Sequential steps -> Single-page layout with clear sections. Goal -> Guide a linear process. Justification -> Reinforces the start-to-finish nature of the learning exercise.
        - Tasks/Steps: Different phases -> Styled cards/boxes. Goal -> Organize & Delineate. Interaction -> Read and follow. Justification -> Visually separates the distinct phases of the workflow.
        - Prompts/Code: Example prompts -> Code-style blocks with copy buttons. Goal -> Action. Interaction -> Click to copy. Justification -> Provides direct utility.

                    <p class="mt-2">It's easy to read an AI's explanation and <em class="italic">think</em> you understand it. This is <strong class="font-semibold">passive learning</strong> and is often shallow. We want <strong class="font-semibold">active learning</strong>, where you can prove you've retained and can apply the knowledge.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2">To fight this, we will use a <strong class="font-semibold">"Test-First" Approach</strong>. You will use an LLM to generate a "final exam" for your chosen topic *before* you start learning it. You will then study the topic, and finally, take the exam to see what you *actually* learned.</p>
