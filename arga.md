# [CIS 7000: Accelerating Research with Generative AI (Fall 2025)][site]

This seminar explores practical approaches for researchers to effectively utilize Generative AI models through hands-on experimentation and exploration. Students will investigate applying these models to research tasks such as summarizing literature, writing assistance, code development, and visual aid creation. Potential topics include effective prompting, critical evaluation of outputs, and responsible use considerations including relevant ethics and safety. Students are expected to be familiar with and actively engaged in research methodology.
