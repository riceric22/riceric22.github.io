# [3990-002: Mathematics of Machine Learning (Fall 2023)][site]

Machine learning is the study of algorithms (i.e. gradient descent) that learn functions (i.e. deep networks) from experience (i.e. data). 
Behind this simple statement, is a lot of mathematical scaffolding: statistics for handling data, optimization for understanding learning algorithms, and linear algebra to create popular models. 

However, the typical computer science degree typical requires only a basic understanding of these mathematical concepts. This means that taking an advanced machine learning course may require taking multiple courses across graduate statistics and mathematics just to get up to speed.  

To better prepare undergraduates for machine learning coursework, this course aims to provide the missing background required to be able to take advanced coursework in machine learning. This course will be based on the [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/) textbook, which covers the mathematical foundations of machine learning as well as examples of how machine learning algorithms that use these foundations. 

**Prerequisites**: We will assume you've taken the [minimum mathematics requirements of the Penn CS degree](https://catalog.upenn.edu/undergraduate/programs/computer-science-bse/). That is: 
+ CIS1600 (CS foundations)
+ CIS2610 or equivalent (discrete probability)
+ MATH1400/MATH1410 or equivalent (calculus)
+ MATH2400 or equivalent (linear algebra)

**Structure**: We will build upon these foundations and cover a more in depth study suited for machine learning problems. Particular areas of focus are: 

+ Continuous probability
+ Vector calculus
+ Linear algebra and matrix decompositions
+ Continuous optimization
+ 
We will accompany these topics with several examples demonstrating how these core techniques are used to prove fundamental results about machine learning algorithms.
